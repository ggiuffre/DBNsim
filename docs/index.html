		<h1>What is DBNsim</h1>

		<p>DBNsim is a web application for training and analysing <strong>Deep Belief Networks</strong> (&quot;<abbr title="Deep Belief Networks">DBNs</abbr>&quot;, for short). A <a target="_" href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_belief_networks">Deep Belief Network</a> is a particular type of artificial neural network; it is a stack of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (&quot;<abbr title="Restricted Boltzmann Machines">RBMs</abbr>&quot;, for short) that can be trained with an algorithm known as <strong>contrastive divergence</strong>. <abbr title="Restricted Boltzmann Machines">RBMs</abbr> learn to reconstruct a given input and, if properly analysed, they can reveal latent features in the distribution of the input.</p>
		<p>DBNsim offers a simple interface for defining the architecture of a <abbr title="Deep Belief Network">DBN</abbr>, train it on a remote web server (optionally equipped with a <abbr title="Graphical Processing Unit">GPU</abbr>), analyse it, and then download the <abbr title="Deep Belief Network">DBN</abbr> in various formats for performing further analyses.</p>

		<h2>How to run it on your machine</h2>
		<p>As said, DBNsim is a web app. That means you can run it on one computer and access it on another. According to your needs, there are several ways in which you can use DBNsim:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If you want to use it locally (i.e. as if it was a normal desktop application on your <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>), you just have to launch the app from the command line with Python; then, you will be able to access the user interface on your browser at the local address <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/DBNtrain/</code>.</li>
			<li>You may want your students to use it in a classroom. For this, you just have to launch the app from the command line and ask your audience to connect their devices to the University network; they will find the user interface at <code>http://your.public.ip.address:8000/DBNtrain/</code>.</li>
			<li>Finally, if you don't have a local intranet like above, you can still publish DBNsim on a remote web server: it will then be available from any computer connected to the internet.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In all three cases, you can follow <a href="01_launching.html#install">this</a> step-by-step guide.</p>
		<p>Launching DBNsim from a computer equipped with a <a target="_" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA-enabled <abbr title="Graphical Processing Unit">GPU</abbr></a> lets you train a <abbr title="Deep Belief Network">DBN</abbr> directly on the <abbr title="Graphical Processing Unit">GPU</abbr>; DBNsim should automatically detect whether or not your computer has a <abbr title="Graphical Processing Unit">GPU</abbr>. The main advantage of using it is speed: you will be able to train much larger networks in fewer time.</p>
